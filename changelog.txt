Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2021.10.18
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the infinite recursion / stack overflow crash that occured with some recipes of some
      overhaul mods, by no longer allowing the Decomposer to enter cycles.
  Minor Features:
    - Recipes with the allow_decomposition property set to false can now be used by the mod too.
  Locale:
    - Added a tooltip to the choose_recipe_button to better inform the player about how the recipe
      can be unselected. This replaces the default tooltip (which displays the recipe itself).
  Other:
    - Removed the keybind for "completely" resetting the calculator (CTRL + ALT + C by default),
      because it was only useful for debugging and I don't need it anymore.
    - Removed the "Possible performance issues" disclaimer from the mod portal's long description.
      I believe it to be a non issue now because of some optimizations I had made before the
      initial release. If this problem resurfaces, I might add the disclaimer back in.
